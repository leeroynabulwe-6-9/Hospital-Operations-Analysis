# Hospital-Operations-Analysis
This project analyzes multi-year hospital data from City General Hospital to uncover the root causes of operational failures affecting patient flow, staff workload, billing performance, medication management, and laboratory efficiency. 
## Objectives
Identify the root causes of operational breakdown
Analyze patient demographics and flow patterns
Evaluate doctor and nurse workload distribution
Examine medication utilization and wastage
Identify insurance billing issues causing revenue loss
Provide actionable, data-driven recommendations
## Dataset Description

Lab Quality Dashboard
Inconclusive test rates, departmental test performance
## Tools Used

## Key Findings
Elderly patients form the majority of ER visits, not teenagers
Staff workload is uneven, causing burnout in some units and idle time in others
Medication stock mismanagement leads to shortages of essential drugs and wastage of slow-moving items
Some insurance providers consistently underpay, contributing to revenue loss
Lab tests have a high inconclusive rate (15%), doubling workflow and delaying care
## Recommendations
Reallocate beds according to actual patient demographics
Balance staff shifts and redistribute patient loads
Improve medication forecasting and inventory control
Strengthen revenue cycle management by auditing insurance partner
Investigate lab equipment and testing procedures to reduce inconclusive results
